Salutations fellow classmates

This is a client server application 

so begin by downloading the repository and running the server (main), afterwards you can run the client.

in your ide open up the output.png file

the purpose of the program is for the client to request new pictures to replace  output.png from the server
the server then sends the picutes over the local net to the client

to see this happening you will have to swap from the output.png tab in your ide to a different tab (this refreshes the tab so you can see the picture changing)
