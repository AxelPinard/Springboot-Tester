Salutations fellow classmates

once you have downloaded this repository and started the server you can open up your browser of choice and go to http:localhost:8080

once there you have the 2 options of /getCRSE and /addCRSE

this is a very basic usage of how to pass data to and from the controller (Ie. server) over a network. 
the string you /addCRSE will appear in the list from /getCRSE

very basic project with not a lot of scope I understand.
